# Reinforcement learning #

This is a collection of simple reinforcement learning projects for my course CAP 5636 Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Fall 2018.

## Taxonomy of reinforcement learning methods ##
https://github.com/schneider128k/reinforcement/blob/master/taxonomy_rl_methods.md

## Random action agents ##

* Random action agent for cart pole

## Linear model for action selection ##

The notebooks implement a simple linear model using numpy. We compute the inner product between a weight vector and the state vector. The action is selected depending on whether this inner product is negative or non-negative. 

* Random search for linear model agent for cart pole
* Hill climbing search for linear model agent for cart pole (not better than random search for this particularly simple problem)
* Random search for liner model agent for mountain car

## Tabular Q-learning ##

The notebooks implement tabular q-learning using numpy.

* Tabular Q-learning for frozen lake
* Tabular Q-learning for taxi

## Simple linear model and convolutional neural network for recognizing hand-written digits ##

The first notebook implements a simple linear model for recognizing hand-written digits in the MNIST data set with TensorFlow. I want to briefly introduce neurals networks and TensorFlow in the context of this basic task in supervised learning.  

Once we become more familiar with neural networks and TensorFlow, I will show how to use neural networks to approximate q-values for simple reinforcement learning tasks such as cartpole and mountain car.

The second notebook implements a convolutional neural network for recognizing hand-written digits. We need to use convolutional neural networks to approximate q-values for more advanced tasks such as playing Atari games.

Note that this is going to be a very brief introduction to neural networks and TensorFlow. I am going to be teaching an entire class on deep neural networks and TensorFlow in Spring 2019.

## Cross entropy method policy learning ##

* Cross entropy method policy learning for cart pole

## Q-learning with shallow neural networks ##

The notebooks implement q-learning with neural networks using TensorFlow.

* Neural network Q-learning for cart pole 
* Neural network Q-learning for mountain car
